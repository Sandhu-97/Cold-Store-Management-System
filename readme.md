### Problem Statement Number: CBP28
### Problem Statement Title: Student Innovation
### Problem Category: Agricultue, FoodTech, Rural Development


### Idea
We are going to create Cold Store Management System which will act as a inventory management system and a marketplace for farmers to sell their crops.
The software hopes to ease the life of farmers and other persons' who are engaged in the primary sector. This will reduce the load of farmers and provide sources of side income.
It brings the much needed technical revolution to the primary industries of India.

#### Flow of the software
This is going to be a windows desktop application.
Users will be greeted with a login/signup page. 
After successfully logging in the users will be greeted with a home menu consisting of many options such as
1. View their record with store i.e. how many packets of crops they have stored in the store
2. Add their crops to the farmer's marketplace
3. Buy crops from other farmers and add to their inventory

Admins will have following options on the home page:
1. View inventory of all farmers
2. Make changes to the inventory
3. Facilitate the marketplace
